      <hr >
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I had visited Disney World in June 2016 and May 2023</h5>
      <p>Disney World is a castle with many different variations of rides for all ages of children. Personally, my favorite thing about Disney World was the new Tron ride that came out in 2023. It was very, very fast and I felt that I would fall off the lightcycle. You can enjoy the wonders of small shops and little machines as well! I hope that Disney will continue to grow with its amazing path that it's headed to.</p>

    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Tron Ride (amazing)</kbd></h4>
    <p>The new Tron ride came out in 2023 and it is the fastest ride in the whole world. You sit on a motorcycle looking thing, and you push a handle to secure yourself onto the bike. But get ready! As soon as everyone's done, the bikes take you to a starting point, and a counter charges your bike up. When the counter does a third strike, you go flying with max speed as you are on the bike. It's amazing and I recommend you try it.</p>

      <p>I watched this movie yesterday and I absolutely loved it. You have to watch the first movie which is Spiderman: Into The Spider-Verse. I feel this movie is a bit better because it explains the storyline about Miles and his friend, Gwen Stacy. You should really try watching this movie. There are multiple Spidermans for you to experience in this. Miles meets a lot of them, but as soon as he's betrayed, they start attacking him like he's the villain, even though he did nothing. In the end, he finds his clone which was a bad guy called The Prowler. He needs to get back to his home. Will he make it, or will he break it?</p>

          <p>I watched Sonic as soon as it came out. It was amazing. It is about this little hedgehog being abducted by a villain named Dr. Robotnik, or as Sonic says, Eggman. It is action-packed as he fights him towards the end. Sonic meets a friend named Tom Wachoski. He loves calling him the Donut Lord. They both each help each other as the misery and violence goes on.</p>
